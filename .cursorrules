Use Radix Theme components.
I have tailwind as well, so if needed use these as well.
Use lucide-react icons.

Make the UI delightful!, compact, skeumorphic, heavily inspired by Linear.
Use radix colors for tailwind (e.g. text-gray-12)
Cut down on the amount of padding and margin.
Add text-base tailwind class when you want to use the default font size.
